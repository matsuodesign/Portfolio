          My day to day specialty was working on interaction design projects, and developing ways to improve the quality of design/engineering collaboration. Our team was often tasked with spearheading new product exploration, while testing and iterating product concepts under development. Over my tenure I worked on a variety of project types, including the development and launch of a social community, iPad and mobile applications, and hands on involvement  with a rearchitecture of the front end code base.

          In addition to interactive work, I also had the opportunity to lead the push for a complete rearchitecture of the presentation layer and its corresponding front end codebase. Part of the effort involved updating our design workflow to the latest industry standards, transitioning from photoshop and specs into systems that would automate common tasks; allowing the design team direct but moderated access to the front end code base and enabling rapid prototyping with nearly production ready code.
