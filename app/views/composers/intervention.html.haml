     After some experience I started a party of my own along with my best friend and DJ partner, a monthly event at San Franisco's Ruby Skye night club. We orchastrated all aspects of the marketing campaign and promotional materials for the party, including print production for environmental signage and event fliers, motion graphics for party visuals, branding, and a social marketing campaign.
