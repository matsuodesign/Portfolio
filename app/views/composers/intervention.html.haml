          After some experience I started a party of my own along with my best friend and DJ partner, a monthly event at San Franisco's Ruby Skye night club.

      %h4.clear.section-header We Created a Brand, Photos by Plurhype
      %p#plurhype-1 At it's peak our brand 'Plurhype' employeed a team of 15 photographers throughout California, whos photos were published through plurhype.com. This was a great strategy for direct marketing because people would visit the website to find their photos, and subsequently see our advertisements, and upcoming events. People became friends with our photographers, and before long Plurhype was a well recognised brand in the party promotion scene.
