          Starting from photoshop mocks designed by Vadim Fedotov of Big Bold Labs, I helped create both the web experience for the Kudosed app landing page as well as a web wrapper for message display when prospective users haven't yet downloaded the app.

        My responsibilities included translating the static mocks into a responsive design, imagining interactions for viewport scaling on desktop, and delivering the final front end code. I chose to work using HAML and SASS for efficiency, and to create source files that could be reused as resources for future projects.
